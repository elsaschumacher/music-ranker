# Music Ranker

This website allows users to rank their favorite songs. Currently, it features Taylor Swift's discography, and the albums and their tracks are fetched from Spotify API. The tech stack includes Next.js, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, Planetscale and DaisyUI.

The project is deployed at https://music-ranker-pi.vercel.app/! Hope you have fun rating the tunes ðŸ˜ŠðŸŽµ

## Reflections

In general, I had a lot of fun developing this app, and it allowed me to delve into the world Next.js and serverless architecture especially. It was exciting to be able to combine my favorite artist's music and coding into a project. I noticed that the website is quite slow, and this would be something to improve in the future. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
